#H1 Tamagotchi Pet Game
Welcome to Tamagotchi Pet Game.
This is a game where you take care of the pet in various ways. Your target is to keep the pet alive by choosing to feed it when hungry , turn off lights when sleepy or tired and finally play with it (It gets bored!!). 


#As part of the GA SEI course this project was designed and coded. It demonstrates the ability of student to project their learned skills of javascript DOM manipulation , jquery , css animations , css styling to be put together in modernizing a popular 90's game.

#User stories
#The game has to have a functionality of not ending as long as you are capable of taking care of the pet.
The game can end only when any of the meters fill up.
The pet should have characteristics and age which grows at certain interval.

#the approach taken
#Started with the basic approach to fulfill the minimum functionality required.
Started with a basic wireframe of how the game looks like. With 3 buttons which will append or decerement the meters when action taken.
Instead of starting with styling , i have started with creation of class objects for the pet itself in js and giving it the characteristics there. Once that was up , i started working on getting the meters up for the game. 
There was some pause here as i had to go back into css and html to update the visual content for meters. There was also some challenege in getting these meters updated and with the break room discussion got this solved. Had the basic meters dynamically updated.
I did spend quite an amount of time on getting the styling ready with experimentation on how it looked like. 
The animations was a struggle , so took the path of changing images on timing and click of the buttons. 
Functionality wise , did every thing as per the specification and did multiple rounds of testng to get it to the level expected.
